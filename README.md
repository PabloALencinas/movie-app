# MOVIE-app
This is a personal Project build with Java/SpringBoot for the Backend and Javascript/ReactJS for the Frontend. It's a simple movie application with some movies examples. You can see some movies with a particular Design and you can add reviews for some of those movies in particular.

## You can check the 'README.md' inside of the Backend and Frontend Section and you'll see some notes from me about steps and a simple guide of how was build each one.
